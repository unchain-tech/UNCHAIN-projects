## Deploy your subgraph

### ✅ Ship your updated Subgraph

```
yarn local-ship
```

![](/public/images/TheGraph-ScaffoldEth2/section-1/1_3_1.png)

Be sure to add a new version number to your subgraph when it prompts you. This should be higher then the previous version.

Next we will test out the subgraph and make sure it is indexing correctly.
