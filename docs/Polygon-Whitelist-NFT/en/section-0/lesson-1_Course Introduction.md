## GETTING STARTED

### 🎉 Self Introduction

Hi everyone, I'm your teacher WTOM. In this tutorial, I will show you guys how to use ChainIDE to develop a dApp that allows only whitelisted users to mint NFTs. This tutorial requires some knowledge of Solidity, TypeScript, and React, but don't worry, I'll help you pick up these skills in the upcoming lessons.

### 🎓 What is ChainIDE?

[ChainIDE](https://chainide.com/) is a cloud-based IDE for developing decentralized applications, supporting various blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Conflux, Nervos, Dfinity, Flow and Aptos. Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Conflux, Nervos, Dfinity, Flow, Aptos, etc.

It comes pre-populated with the necessary plug-ins for development, as well as modules for writing, compiling, debugging, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Therefore, you can start coding right away without having to build a complex environment.

### 🧱 What we are building

We want to build an NFT minting page but only allow certain people to claim the NFTs.

To elaborate, the dApp will allow users to connect their Metamask wallets, and only users on the whitelist will have access to Mint. Once users finish minting, they can resell these NFTs on the NFT secondary market or hold them. That's a small summary of what we're going to do in this lesson.

This is the mint page：

This is how it looks like on OpenSea once we finished:
