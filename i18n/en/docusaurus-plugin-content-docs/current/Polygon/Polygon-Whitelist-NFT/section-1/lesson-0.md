## GETTING STARTED

### üéâ Self Introduction

Hi everyone, I'm your teacher WTOM. In this tutorial, I will show you guys how to use ChainIDE to develop a dApp that allows only whitelisted users to mint NFTs. This tutorial requires some knowledge of Solidity, TypeScript, and React, but don't worry, I'll help you pick up these skills in the upcoming lessons.

### üéì What is ChainIDE?

[ChainIDE](https://chainide.com/) is a cloud-based IDE for developing decentralized applications supporting various blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Conflux, Nervos, Dfinity, Flow, Aptos, etc.

It comes pre-populated with the necessary plug-ins for development, as well as modules for writing, compiling, debugging, testing, and deploying„Çπ„Éû„Éº„Éà„Ç≥„É≥„Éà„É©„ÇØ„Éà. Therefore, you can start coding right away without having to build a complex environment.

### üß± What we are building

We want to build an NFT minting page but only allow certain people to claim the NFTs.

To elaborate, the dApp will allow users to connect their Metamask wallets, and only users on the whitelist will have access to Mint. Once users finish minting, they can resell these NFTs on the NFT secondary market or hold them. That's a small summary of what we're going to do in this lesson.

This is the mint pageÔºö

This is how it looks like on OpenSea once we finished:

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Create an `Issue`

If you feel that you want to leave a suggestion but not enough to send a `pull request`, you can create an `Issue` at [here](https://github.com/unchain-tech/UNCHAIN-projects/issues).

See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for information on how to create an `Issue`).

Creating `pull request` and `issues` is an important task when actually developing as a team, so please try it.

Let's make the UNCHAIN project better together ‚ú®.

### üß∞ Preparation

#### üõ† Setup MetaMask wallet

##### Install MetaMask

When we deploy a smart contract to the blockchain or interact with a deployed smart contract, we need to pay for gas. Therefore, we need a web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Click here to install MetaMask.[here](https://metamask.io/)

##### Add Polygon Amoy to MetaMask

Polygon is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that enables developers to build scalable, user-friendly dApps with low transaction fees without sacrificing security. Major NFT platforms such as Opensea and Rarible also support the Polygon Amoy testnet, so we choose Amoy to deploy our smart contract.

Open [ChainIDE](https://chainide.com/), and click the "Try Now" button on the front page as shown in the figure below.

Next, you will select your preferred login method. The login prompt offers two options: "Sign in with GitHub" and "Continue as Guest". For the purposes of this tutorial, we will select "Sign in with GitHub" because the Sandbox feature is not available in Guest mode.

To create a new Polygon project, click the 'New Project' button and choose 'Polygon' on the left side of the screen. Next, on the right side, select ‚ÄùBlank Template‚Äú.

Click "Connect wallet" on the right side of the screen, select "Injected web3 Provider," and then click on MetaMask to connect the walletÔºàPolygon Mainnet is the main network, while Amoy is the testnet - we choose to Connect to AmoyÔºâ.

##### Claim testnet tokens

Once Amoy is added to MetaMask, click on [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) to receive testnet tokens. On the faucet page, we choose Amoy as the network and MATIC as the token and then paste your MetaMask wallet address. Next, click submit, and the faucet will send you some test MATIC within a minute.
