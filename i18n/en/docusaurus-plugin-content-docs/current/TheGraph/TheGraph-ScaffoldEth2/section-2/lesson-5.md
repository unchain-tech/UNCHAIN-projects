#### ✅ Init your Subgraph

This can be done in a separate folder of your choosing, since it will initiate a yarn package. You will need to fill in the required configuration during the initialization process.The Start Block - Can be found on Etherescan if needed so you don't have to index the entire previous blocks.

```
graph init --studio name_of_your_subgraph
```

It should looks something like this...

#### ✅ Authenticate to Studio

Grab your authentication string from Auth & Deploy on Subgraph Studio.

```
graph auth --studio auth_key_here
```

Success looks like this:

```
Deploy key set for https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
```

#### ✅ Run codegen and build your subgraph

You will need to change into the directory where the subgraph was created in the previous step.

```
cd sendmessage
graph codegen && graph build
```

Success will look something like the following!

```

Choose a version and fire away!

It might take up to 5 minutes for you subgraph to deploy to the studio. Once it has been deployed, you can check that is fully syncing and has no errors. A successful deploy will look like the following.
